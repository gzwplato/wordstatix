# WordStatix

WordStatix is a free and multiplatform software useful to create concordances, that are lists of the
words used within a document along with their recurrence and context. The document may be
structured in chapters, numbers or in any another way. The software allows to track specific words
by prefix or suffix, to skip those which are meaningless (like articles or prepositions) or numbers, to
create a simple statistic of the recurrence of all words or of some of them, possibly within the
different sections of the document, and to create three kind of diagrams to visualize the statistical
data in different ways.

WordStatix is free software and is released under the GPL license version 3 or following. It has
been created with Free Pascal and Lazarus (http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org).
